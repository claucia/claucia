# Hi there, I'm Cláucia 👋🏼

I am originally from Brazil, and I descend from an Italian family. Well, I reckon my name is not easy to pronounce, so you could simply call me **Nica**, which is my nickname. My family and close friends call me like that since I was a child :)  

I moved to Ireland in mid-2018 and, since then I’ve been [working][cv] on hospitality, which was heavily affected by the COVID-19 restrictions. So, during a layoff from work, I started studying Web technologies such as HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript. I also obtained certifications from Microsoft to assert these skills.

I am currently enrolled in an online course called [CS50x][cs50x] provided by HarvardX via edX. It's been a fantastic opportunity to learn the art of programming with the best teachers. 

My next goal is to learn React, and improve my skills in UI/UX.

By the way, I strongly believe that learning by practicing is the best way to learn. With that in mind, I found an interesting way to get some hands-on experience: [Frontend Mentor challenges][frontend-mentor-challenges]. There’s a huge collection of challenges to choose from. And I can say it’s been a challenging and rewarding experience.
